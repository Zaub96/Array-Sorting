# Array-Sorting
Quick code to sort an Array
This pracice problem deals with Arrays and an easy way to sort them in as relatively least amount of lines as I could make an attempt at.
I think there are a couple issues mainly with naming and return prompts, but im not too worried as the main code looks good.
Basically just defining range and defining how to sort it as such
